## Installation  
### CocoaPods

To integrate this into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), add it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'TRVideoView'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage  
```swift
// Initialize  
let video = TRVideoView(text: "This is some sample text with a YouTube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAloq5MCUA")

// Or to play inline, initialize as
let video = TRVideoView(text: "This is some sample text with a YouTube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAloq5MCUA", allowInlinePlayback: true)

// Set the frame as always, or use AutoLayout
video.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 150)

// Returns true or false (checks for YouTube and Vimeo urls)
video.containsURLs()

// Returns String with out URLs (i.e. "This is some sample text with a YouTube link")
let text = video.textWithoutURLs()

// Finally add it to your view
self.view.addSubview(video)
```

## Notes on links
For YouTube either `https://youtu.be/QPAloq5MCUA` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAloq5MCUA` works.  
For Vimeo use `https://vimeo.com/86033976`  
If other parameters are also included in the link it does not matter, they are sorted out.
